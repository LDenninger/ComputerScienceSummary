# Summaries of the Computer Science Courses and additional literature

This repository holds summaries from the computer science course of the University Bonn ("Universit√§t Bonn"). Note that the bachelor is in german, so a big part of the summaries are in german.

The summaries are all hand-written but can still give a comprehensable summary to learn or compare for the exams.
